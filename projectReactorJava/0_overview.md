I'd be happy to help you prepare for your upcoming interview on Project Reactor! Let's cover this topic in depth to ensure you're well-prepared.

# Project Reactor Overview

Project Reactor is a fourth-generation reactive library built on the Reactive Streams specification for building non-blocking applications on the JVM. It's particularly important for Spring WebFlux, Spring's reactive web framework.

Let's go through the key concepts, components, and patterns you should know:

## Core Types in Project Reactor

1. **Mono<T>** - A publisher that emits 0 or 1 element
2. **Flux<T>** - A publisher that emits 0 to N elements

## Key Operators You Should Know

Let's break down some of the most important operators:

### Creation Operators
- `just()` - Create from a known value
- `fromIterable()` - Create from a collection
- `range()` - Create from a range of numbers
- `empty()` - Create an empty publisher
- `error()` - Create a publisher that emits an error
- `defer()` - Create a publisher that waits for subscription

### Transformation Operators
- `map()` - Transform each element
- `flatMap()` - Transform and flatten results
- `concatMap()` - Like flatMap but preserves order
- `handle()` - Custom transformation with filtering

### Filtering Operators
- `filter()` - Include elements that match a predicate
- `take()` - Take a limited number of elements
- `skip()` - Skip a number of elements
- `distinct()` - Remove duplicates

### Combining Operators
- `mergeWith()` - Combine multiple publishers
- `zip()` - Combine elements from multiple publishers
- `concat()` - Subscribe to publishers sequentially

### Error Handling
- `onErrorReturn()` - Return a fallback value on error
- `onErrorResume()` - Switch to a fallback publisher on error
- `retry()` - Resubscribe on error
- `timeout()` - Error if no emission within time

Would you like me to cover any specific aspects of Project Reactor in more detail? For example, we could dive deeper into:
- Backpressure strategies
- Schedulers and concurrency
- Testing reactive streams
- Common interview questions
- Advanced operators like window, buffer, groupBy

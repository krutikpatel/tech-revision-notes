<>Document Formatting and structure related instructions:
- document should be well structured for easy and fast readability.
- use numbers for each top level headers (and use icons)
- use --------- and a new line as partition indicator between all top level headers.
- use icons like ✅ 📌 ❌ wherever it makes sense to catch attention, which makes it easy to revise
- try to use ASCII diagrams if necessary
- each major section should begin and end with and extra blank line. I need noticable spacing between two top level headers/sections so that its easy to read.
- make it more reader engaging (example: add icons, and other tactics)

# Important Classes and Interfaces for WebFilter in Spring WebFlux

Here's a comprehensive overview of the key classes and interfaces related to WebFilter in Spring WebFlux:

## Core Interfaces

1. **WebFilter**
   - The primary interface for implementing filters
   - Contains `filter(ServerWebExchange, WebFilterChain)` method
   - Returns `Mono<Void>`

2. **WebFilterChain**
   - Represents the chain of filters
   - Contains `filter(ServerWebExchange)` method
   - Used to pass control to the next filter

3. **ServerWebExchange**
   - Encapsulates HTTP request and response
   - Provides access to request and response objects
   - Contains attributes for sharing data between components
   - Offers mutation methods to create modified exchanges

## Supporting Interfaces

4. **Ordered**
   - Interface for controlling filter execution order
   - Contains `getOrder()` method
   - Can be implemented by WebFilter implementations

5. **ReactiveAdapter**
   - Helps with reactive type conversions
   - Used internally for reactive operations in filters

## Core Classes

6. **ServerHttpRequest**
   - Represents HTTP request in reactive applications
   - Provides access to headers, query parameters, and body

7. **ServerHttpResponse**
   - Represents HTTP response in reactive applications
   - Provides methods to set status, headers, and write body

8. **DefaultWebFilterChain**
   - Default implementation of WebFilterChain
   - Manages the execution of a list of WebFilters

9. **WebFilterManager**
   - Manages WebFilter instances in the application
   - Handles filter registration and ordering

## Utility and Helper Classes

10. **ServerWebExchangeUtils**
    - Utility methods for working with ServerWebExchange
    - Provides helper functions for common operations

11. **WebHttpHandlerBuilder**
    - Used to build HTTP request handlers with filters
    - Allows programmatic assembly of handler chains

12. **DataBufferUtils**
    - Utilities for working with DataBuffer objects
    - Crucial for request/response body manipulation

13. **ServerWebExchangeDecorator**
    - Base class for decorating ServerWebExchange
    - Useful for adding behavior to exchange objects

14. **ServerHttpRequestDecorator** & **ServerHttpResponseDecorator**
    - For decorating request and response objects
    - Used for modifying or intercepting request/response behavior

## Specialized Filter Implementations

15. **CorsWebFilter**
    - Implementation of CORS functionality
    - Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

16. **WebFluxTags**
    - Provides metric tags for WebFlux
    - Used with monitoring systems

17. **MetricsWebFilter**
    - Records metrics about HTTP requests
    - Integrates with Micrometer

18. **ForwardedHeaderTransformer**
    - Transforms forwarded headers
    - Handles proxy-related headers

## Configuration and Registration Classes

19. **WebFluxConfigurer**
    - Interface for configuring WebFlux applications
    - Can be implemented to customize WebFlux behavior

20. **WebFluxConfigurationSupport**
    - Base class for WebFlux configuration
    - Provides default configuration

21. **WebFluxAutoConfiguration**
    - Spring Boot auto-configuration for WebFlux
    - Configures default filters and handlers

22. **ReactiveWebServerApplicationContext**
    - Application context for reactive web applications
    - Manages bean lifecycle including filters

These classes and interfaces form the foundation of the WebFilter system in Spring WebFlux, providing a comprehensive framework for implementing reactive request processing chains.

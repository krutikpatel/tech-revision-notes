- **Program**
    - read topic from list
        - prioritize by priority col, if mentioned
        - once fetched - update last revision date
        - pick topic that does not have ‚Äúlast revision date‚Äù column set or has oldest date
        - generate prompt and fetch response in markdown format
            - optional - refine from multiple llms ?
                - gpt has better structure and language
                - claude may add more code
    - bookmark topic/article feature
        - has ability browse and read bookmarked topic
        - set priority?
        - 
- **Prompt**
    
    You are a senior/seasoned Java engineer and interview coach.
    I am medium experienced Java engineer
    Your goal is to give me comprehensive list of java language topics to study and prepare .
    List should be well categorized with bullet points and sub-points
    
- **Imp refining prompt by gpt !**
    
    Before I rewrite, do you want the style to be more like:
    
    1. **Interview-focused revision notes** (short, crisp, with "why interviewers ask this" angle)?
    2. **Detailed learning guide** (slightly longer explanations, but still concise)?
    3. **Both combined** (explanation + interview traps + best practices)?
    
    Also, should I:
    
    - Include **simple diagrams** where it helps visualize concepts?
    - Highlight **common mistakes and trick questions** interviewers ask?
    - Add **mini coding exercises** at the end to reinforce learning?
    
    And finally, confirm tone:
    
    > üéØ Friendly senior engineer explaining to a peer
    > 
    > 
    > or
    > 
    > üìö **Professional interview coach style**
    > 
    
    Once you confirm, I'll generate a polished version tailored perfectly!

    # üß± Java Constructor Overloading & Chaining
    
    üïê **Total Read Time: ~7‚Äì9 minutes**
    
    üéØ *For mid-level developers prepping for interviews*
    
    ---
    
    ## ‚úÖ Part 1: Constructor Overloading
    
    ### üîç What is it?
    
    Constructor Overloading means having **multiple constructors** in a class with the **same name** (class name), but **different parameter lists**.
    
    ### üí° Why it exists:
    
    - You may want to allow objects to be created **with varying levels of detail**.
    - Default values are handled cleanly without repeating logic.
    
    ---
    
    ### üß† Interview Insight
    
    > Q: Why does Java allow constructor overloading?
    > 
    > 
    > A: For flexibility ‚Äî sometimes you only have part of the data when creating an object.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### ‚úçÔ∏è Syntax Example:
    
    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        private int age;
        private String address;
    
        public Person() {
            this.name = "Unknown";
            this.age = 0;
            this.address = "No address";
        }
    
        public Person(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = 0;
            this.address = "No address";
        }
    
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.address = "No address";
        }
    
        public Person(String name, int age, String address) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.address = address;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### üìå Key Rules:
    
    - ‚úÖ Same name as the class
    - ‚úÖ Different parameter list
    - ‚úÖ No return type ‚Äî not even `void`
    
    ---
    
    ### üß™ Usage Example:
    
    ```java
    new Person();                            // all default
    new Person("Alice");                     // name only
    new Person("Alice", 30);                 // name & age
    new Person("Alice", 30, "Bangalore");    // full data
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## üö® Common Mistakes:
    
    | ‚ùå Mistake | üò± Problem |
    | --- | --- |
    | Same parameter types in different order | Not valid overloading |
    | Return type difference only | Doesn‚Äôt count as overloading |
    
    ---
    
    ## ‚úÖ Part 2: Constructor Chaining
    
    ### üîç What is it?
    
    **Constructor Chaining** is when **one constructor calls another**:
    
    - Inside the **same class** using `this(...)`
    - From a **parent class** using `super(...)`
    
    ---
    
    ### üß† Interview Insight
    
    > Q: Why use constructor chaining?
    > 
    > 
    > A: To centralize logic in **one constructor**, and reuse it through others, following the **DRY** (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principle.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### üß≠ Visual Guide:
    
    ```
    this(...)  ‚Üí another constructor in same class
    super(...) ‚Üí constructor in parent class
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### üß™ Example: `this(...)` Chaining
    
    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        private int age;
        private String address;
    
        public Person() {
            this("Unknown", 0, "No address");
        }
    
        public Person(String name) {
            this(name, 0, "No address");
        }
    
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this(name, age, "No address");
        }
    
        public Person(String name, int age, String address) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.address = address;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    All simpler constructors chain to the full constructor ‚Äî keeping logic centralized.
    
    ---
    
    ### üß™ Example: `super(...)` Chaining
    
    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        private int age;
    
        public Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
    
    public class Employee extends Person {
        private String empId;
    
        public Employee() {
            super("Unknown", 0); // parent constructor

    | ‚ö† Rule | ‚ùóWhy It Matters |
    | --- | --- |
    | `this()` or `super()` must be **first statement** | Otherwise: compiler error |
    | You **can‚Äôt** use both `this()` and `super()` in the same constructor | Choose one |
    | Avoid **recursive constructor calls** | Leads to `StackOverflowError` |

    ## üíé Best Practices
    
    ‚úÖ Use constructor overloading to support various initialization needs
    
    ‚úÖ Use chaining to prevent logic duplication
    
    ‚úÖ Chain to the **most detailed constructor**
    
    ‚úÖ Add **documentation/comments** if constructor logic gets complex

    ## üéØ Final Interview Summary
    
    | Concept | Summary |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Constructor Overloading** | Same class name, different parameter lists |
    | **Constructor Chaining** | Reuse logic by calling `this(...)` or `super(...)` |
    | **`this()` vs `super()`** | Same class vs parent class |
    | **Why it‚Äôs asked** | Tests understanding of object construction & OOP design |

    ## üß™ Mini Coding Challenge
    
    **Write a class `Book` with the following constructors:**
    
    - No-arg ‚Üí sets `"Untitled"` and price `0.0`
    - One-arg (title) ‚Üí price defaults to `0.0`
    - Two-arg (title, price)
    - Use **constructor chaining** to avoid repetition
    
    Want me to review your solution when you're done? Or should we move to the next concept like **static blocks vs constructors**?

You are a senior/seasoned Java engineer and interview coach.

I am medium experienced Java engineer

Your task is to teach me following Java topic (think software engineering interviews). Include code examples when necessary:
"Object-Oriented Programming in Java  -> Nested Classes ->
        - Static nested classes
        - Inner classes
        - Local classes
        - Anonymous classes
        - Capturing variables from enclosing scope"

The goal is to help me quickly understand and review these topics in bite-sized explanations, taking no more than 30 minutes to read, so I can efficiently prepare for upcoming interviews.

Response should include:

✅

**Clear, structured learning**

✅

**Interview-ready insights**

✅

**Mini code snippets**

✅

**Common mistakes + traps**

✅

**Best practices**

✅

Summary (for super quick revision)

Summary  tabular format (for super quick revision)

<>Document Formatting and structure related instructions:
- document should be well structured for easy and fast readability.
- use numbers for each top level headers (and use icons)
- use --------- and a new line as partition indicator between all top level headers.
- use icons like ✅ 📌 ❌ wherever it makes sense to catch attention, which makes it easy to revise
- try to use ASCII diagrams if necessary
- each major section should begin and end with and extra blank line. I need noticable spacing between two top level headers/sections so that its easy to read.
- make it more reader engaging (example: add icons, and other tactics)

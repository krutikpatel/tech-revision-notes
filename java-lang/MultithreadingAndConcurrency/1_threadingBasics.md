# Java Multithreading and Concurrency for Interviews üßµ

I'll guide you through these essential multithreading concepts with a focus on interview preparation. Let's break it down into clear, bite-sized sections.

## 1. üöÄ Creating Threads: Thread vs Runnable vs Callable

### Thread Class

The most direct way to create a thread is by extending the `Thread` class:

```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple implementation
‚ùå **Cons**: Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, so extending Thread limits your class hierarchy

### Runnable Interface

Implementing the `Runnable` interface is generally preferred:

```java
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start(); // Starts the thread
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Pros**: Allows your class to extend other classes, better for OOP design
‚úÖ **Pros**: Can pass the same Runnable to multiple threads
‚ùå **Cons**: Cannot return results or throw checked exceptions

### Callable Interface

For tasks that need to return results or throw exceptions:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
    @Override
    public String call() throws Exception {
        return "Thread result: " + Thread.currentThread().getName();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(new MyCallable());
        
        String result = future.get(); // Blocks until result is available
        System.out.println(result);
        
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Pros**: Can return results and throw checked exceptions
‚úÖ **Pros**: Works with ExecutorService for advanced thread management
‚ùå **Cons**: More complex implementation than Runnable

üìå **Interview Insight**: Know when to use each approach:
- Use `Thread` for simple, standalone threads (rare in practice)
- Use `Runnable` for most general threading needs
- Use `Callable` when you need return values or exception handling

## 2. ‚è±Ô∏è Thread Lifecycle and States

A Java thread goes through various states during its lifecycle:

```
NEW ‚Üí RUNNABLE ‚Üí [BLOCKED/WAITING/TIMED_WAITING] ‚Üí TERMINATED
```

### Thread States Detailed

1. **NEW**: Thread created but not started yet
   ```java
   Thread t = new Thread(); // Thread is NEW
   ```

2. **RUNNABLE**: Thread is executing or ready to execute
   ```java
   t.start(); // Thread becomes RUNNABLE
   ```

3. **BLOCKED**: Thread waiting to acquire a monitor lock
   ```java
   synchronized(object) { /* Thread may be BLOCKED here */ }
   ```

4. **WAITING**: Thread waiting indefinitely for another thread
   ```java
   object.wait(); // Thread enters WAITING state
   ```

5. **TIMED_WAITING**: Thread waiting for a specified time
   ```java
   Thread.sleep(1000); // Thread in TIMED_WAITING for 1 second
   ```

6. **TERMINATED**: Thread completed execution
   ```java
   // After run() method completes
   ```

You can check a thread's state:
```java
Thread.State state = thread.getState();
System.out.println("Current state: " + state);
```

ASCII Diagram of Thread Lifecycle:
```
              start()               
  NEW ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí RUNNABLE ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí TERMINATED
                             ‚Üë  ‚Üì
                             ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ block/wait
                             ‚îÇ  ‚Üì
                     notify, ‚îÇ  BLOCKED/    
                     timeout ‚îÇ  WAITING/  
                             ‚îÇ  TIMED_WAITING
```

üìå **Interview Insight**: Understand that RUNNABLE doesn't guarantee execution - it means the thread is eligible for execution. The actual scheduling depends on the JVM/OS.

-----------

## 3. üîÑ start() vs run()

### start() Method

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Task executing"));
thread.start(); // Creates a new thread and executes run() in that thread
```

### run() Method

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Task executing"));
thread.run(); // Executes run() in the current thread - no new thread created!
```

‚úÖ **Key Differences**:
- `start()`: Creates a new thread and calls `run()` in that new thread
- `run()`: Simply calls the method in the current thread (no multithreading)

‚ùå **Common Mistake**: Calling `run()` directly instead of `start()` when multithreading is intended

üìå **Interview Insight**: Calling `start()` twice on the same Thread object throws `IllegalThreadStateException`. You need to create a new Thread object if you want to start again.

-----------

## 4. üîñ Thread Priorities and Daemon Threads

### Thread Priorities

Thread priorities range from 1 (MIN_PRIORITY) to 10 (MAX_PRIORITY), with 5 (NORM_PRIORITY) as default:

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // Set to highest priority (10)

// Constants available:
// Thread.MIN_PRIORITY (1)
// Thread.NORM_PRIORITY (5)
// Thread.MAX_PRIORITY (10)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Thread priorities are just hints to the scheduler, not guarantees! Different platforms/JVMs handle priorities differently.

### Daemon Threads

Daemon threads are background threads that don't prevent the JVM from exiting:

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
thread.setDaemon(true); // Must be called before start()
thread.start();
```

‚úÖ **Characteristics**:
- JVM exits when only daemon threads remain
- Typical usage: garbage collection, housekeeping tasks
- Any thread created by a daemon thread is also a daemon thread

‚ùå **Common Mistake**: Setting daemon status after calling `start()` throws `IllegalThreadStateException`

üìå **Interview Insight**: If your application has only daemon threads running, the JVM will exit. This is important for service applications that might otherwise hang on exit.

## 5. üìã Common Interview Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Extending Thread when implementing Runnable would be better**
```java
// Avoid this when you also need to extend another class
public class MyClass extends Thread { /*...*/ }

// Better approach
public class MyClass extends BaseClass implements Runnable { /*...*/ }
```

‚ùå **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads accessing/modifying shared data

```java
// Problematic code
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    // Not thread-safe!
    public void increment() {
        count++;  // This is not an atomic operation!
    }
}
```

‚ùå **Deadlocks**: Two or more threads waiting for each other

```java
// Potential deadlock
synchronized(resourceA) {
    // Do something
    synchronized(resourceB) {
        // Do something else
    }
}

// Another thread might do:
synchronized(resourceB) {
    // Do something
    synchronized(resourceA) {
        // Both threads now waiting for each other's resource
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

‚úÖ **Use higher-level concurrency utilities when possible**
```java
// Instead of managing threads directly:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(task);
```

‚úÖ **Prefer immutable objects for thread safety**
```java
// Thread-safe because it's immutable
public final class ImmutableValue {
    private final int value;
    
    public ImmutableValue(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
    
    // No setters, only creates new objects
    public ImmutableValue add(int more) {
        return new ImmutableValue(value + more);
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Use proper synchronization mechanisms**
```java
// Using synchronized keyword
public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}

// Or lock objects
private final Object lock = new Object();
public void increment() {
    synchronized(lock) {
        count++;
    }
}

// Or concurrent collections
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
Map<String, String> threadSafeMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

‚úÖ **Use atomic classes for simple counters**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Counter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
    
    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation
    }
}
```

üìå **Interview Insight**: Be prepared to discuss thread safety strategies and when to use each approach.

## 6. üîç Quick Summary

1. **Thread Creation Options**:
   - Extend `Thread`: Simple but limits inheritance
   - Implement `Runnable`: Flexible, preferred for most cases
   - Implement `Callable`: Use when needing return values or exceptions

2. **Thread Lifecycle**:
   - NEW ‚Üí RUNNABLE ‚Üí BLOCKED/WAITING/TIMED_WAITING ‚Üí TERMINATED

3. **start() vs run()**:
   - `start()`: Creates new thread and calls run() in that thread
   - `run()`: Executes in current thread (no new thread created)

4. **Priorities and Daemon Threads**:
   - Priorities (1-10): Just hints, not guarantees
   - Daemon threads: Background threads that don't block JVM exit

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Use high-level concurrency utilities (ExecutorService)
   - Apply proper synchronization
   - Prefer immutable objects for thread sharing
   - Use atomic variables for counters
   - Avoid extending Thread when possible

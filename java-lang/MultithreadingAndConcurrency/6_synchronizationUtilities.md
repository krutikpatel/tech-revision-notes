# Java Synchronization Utilities for Interviews üß†

I'll help you master Java's synchronization utilities with interview-focused explanations and examples. This guide is structured for efficient learning and quick revision.

## 1. üîÑ CountDownLatch
---------

CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations in other threads completes.

### How it works:
- Initialized with a counter (count)
- Threads call `await()` to wait until count reaches zero
- Other threads call `countDown()` to decrement the counter
- Once count reaches zero, all waiting threads are released
- Cannot be reset once the count reaches zero

### üìå Key Methods:
- `await()` - Makes the current thread wait until latch counts down to zero
- `countDown()` - Decrements the count, releasing all waiting threads when count reaches zero
- `getCount()` - Returns the current count

### ‚úÖ Mini Code Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int threadCount = 3;
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(threadCount);
        
        // Create and start worker threads
        for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) {
            int workerId = i;
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    // Simulate work
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " is working");
                    Thread.sleep(1000 + (int)(Math.random() * 1000));
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " is done");
                    
                    // Signal completion
                    latch.countDown();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }).start();
        }
        
        // Main thread waits for all workers to complete
        System.out.println("Main thread waiting for workers...");
        latch.await();
        System.out.println("All workers finished, main thread proceeding");
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting to call `countDown()` (causes waiting threads to wait forever)
- Not handling interruptions properly
- Trying to reset the latch after it reaches zero

### üí° Interview Tips:
- Used when threads need to wait for a one-time event or set of events
- Great for implementing "wait for initialization" patterns
- Unlike CyclicBarrier, cannot be reused once count reaches zero


## 2. üîÑ CyclicBarrier
---------

CyclicBarrier allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point before proceeding.

### How it works:
- Initialized with a party count (number of threads)
- Each thread calls `await()` when it reaches the barrier
- When all threads reach the barrier, they're all released
- Can be reused after all parties have been released
- Optionally executes a barrier action when all threads arrive

### üìå Key Methods:
- `await()` - Blocks until all parties have called await()
- `reset()` - Resets the barrier to its initial state
- `getNumberWaiting()` - Returns number of parties currently waiting
- `getParties()` - Returns the number of parties required for the barrier to trip

### ‚úÖ Mini Code Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class CyclicBarrierExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int threadCount = 3;
        
        // Create barrier with a runnable that executes when all threads reach barrier
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(threadCount, 
                                () -> System.out.println("Phase completed, all threads continuing"));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) {
            int workerId = i;
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    // Phase 1
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " completed phase 1");
                    barrier.await(); // Wait for all threads to complete phase 1
                    
                    // Phase 2
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " completed phase 2");
                    barrier.await(); // Wait for all threads to complete phase 2
                    
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " finished");
                } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " interrupted");
                }
            }).start();
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes:
- Not handling `BrokenBarrierException` (thrown when barrier is broken)
- Not accounting for thread interruption
- Incorrect thread count leading to deadlock

### üí° Interview Tips:
- Perfect for multi-phase computations where threads need to synchronize
- Unlike CountDownLatch, can be reused multiple times
- Barrier action runs in one of the threads that called await(), not a separate thread


## 3. üîÑ Phaser
---------

Phaser is a more flexible synchronization barrier that can vary in parties and support dynamic registration.

### How it works:
- Like CyclicBarrier but with dynamic party registration/deregistration
- Can advance through multiple phases
- Supports tiered arrivals with parent/child relationships

### üìå Key Methods:
- `register()` - Adds a new party
- `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()` - Arrives and waits for others
- `arriveAndDeregister()` - Arrives and deregisters from future phases
- `arrive()` - Records arrival without waiting
- `getPhase()` - Returns the current phase number

### ‚úÖ Mini Code Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Phaser;

public class PhaserExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int threadCount = 3;
        
        // Create phaser with initial party count of 1 (main thread)
        Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1);
        
        // Register additional parties (worker threads)
        for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) {
            phaser.register(); // Register a new party
            int workerId = i;
            
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    // Phase 1
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " in phase " + phaser.getPhase());
                    Thread.sleep((int)(Math.random() * 1000));
                    phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // Wait for all to arrive
                    
                    // Phase 2
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " in phase " + phaser.getPhase());
                    Thread.sleep((int)(Math.random() * 1000));
                    
                    // This thread won't participate in future phases
                    System.out.println("Worker " + workerId + " deregistering");
                    phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
                    
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }).start();
        }
        
        // Main thread can wait for phase completion and then deregister
        phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // Wait for all threads to complete phase 1
        System.out.println("All threads completed phase " + (phaser.getPhase() - 1));
        
        phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // Wait for all threads to complete phase 2
        System.out.println("All threads completed phase " + (phaser.getPhase() - 1));
        
        // Deregister main thread
        phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes:
- Incorrect party management (forgetting to register/deregister)
- Not tracking phase numbers correctly
- Confusing the different arrival methods
- Inappropriate use when simpler barriers would suffice

### üí° Interview Tips:
- Most flexible synchronization barrier in Java
- Useful for complex multi-phase operations with changing participant counts
- Can be subclassed to customize phase advance logic
- More complex to use correctly than CountDownLatch or CyclicBarrier


## 4. üîÑ Semaphore
---------

Semaphore maintains a set of permits for controlling access to limited resources.

### How it works:
- Initialized with a number of permits
- Threads acquire permits before accessing resources
- Threads release permits when done with resources
- Can be fair or unfair (default)

### üìå Key Methods:
- `acquire()` - Acquires a permit, blocking until one is available
- `release()` - Releases a permit
- `tryAcquire()` - Attempts to acquire a permit without blocking indefinitely
- `availablePermits()` - Returns number of available permits

### ‚úÖ Mini Code Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

public class SemaphoreExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate limited resource pool (e.g., database connections)
        int maxConnections = 3;
        int threadCount = 10;
        
        // Create semaphore with fixed number of permits
        Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(maxConnections, true); // Second arg: fair=true
        
        for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) {
            int clientId = i;
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Client " + clientId + " is waiting for connection");
                    
                    // Acquire connection
                    semaphore.acquire();
                    System.out.println("Client " + clientId + " acquired connection, " +
                                      "available: " + semaphore.availablePermits());
                    
                    // Simulate using the connection
                    Thread.sleep(1000 + (int)(Math.random() * 1000));
                    
                    // Release connection
                    System.out.println("Client " + clientId + " releasing connection");
                    semaphore.release();
                    
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }).start();
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes:
- Not releasing permits (resource leak)
- Releasing more permits than acquired (can increase total permit count)
- Using unfair semaphores when ordering is important
- Not handling interruptions properly

### üí° Interview Tips:
- Perfect for limiting concurrent access to resources
- Can implement mutex locks (using semaphore with 1 permit)
- Fairness parameter ensures FIFO ordering if true
- Unlike locks, permits can be released by any thread, not just the acquirer


## 5. üîÑ Exchanger
---------

Exchanger is a synchronization point where pairs of threads can exchange objects.

### How it works:
- Two threads meet at the exchange point
- Each thread provides an object and receives the object from the other thread
- Can be used with any type using generics

### üìå Key Methods:
- `exchange(V x)` - Waits for another thread and exchanges objects
- `exchange(V x, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` - Same with timeout

### ‚úÖ Mini Code Example:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Exchanger;

public class ExchangerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Exchanger<String> exchanger = new Exchanger<>();
        
        // Producer thread
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                String produced = "Producer Data";
                System.out.println("Producer has: " + produced);
                
                // Exchange data with consumer
                String received = exchanger.exchange(produced);
                
                System.out.println("Producer received: " + received);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }).start();
        
        // Consumer thread
        new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                String consumer = "Consumer Data";
                System.out.println("Consumer has: " + consumer);
                
                // Simulate some work before exchange
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                
                // Exchange data with producer
                String received = exchanger.exchange(consumer);
                
                System.out.println("Consumer received: " + received);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }).start();
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes:
- Using with odd number of threads (one will wait forever)
- Not handling timeout exceptions
- Not handling thread interruptions
- Using for multi-thread exchanges (only supports pairs)

### üí° Interview Tips:
- Simplifies bilateral data transfers
- Efficient for producer-consumer scenarios
- Less commonly used than other synchronizers
- Can be used with null values

## 8. üéØ Interview Strategy Tips
---------

### When asked about synchronization utilities:

‚úÖ **Explain the core purpose first**
- "A CountDownLatch is used when one thread needs to wait for multiple other operations to complete."

‚úÖ **Mention key characteristics**
- "Unlike CyclicBarrier, CountDownLatch cannot be reset after reaching zero."

‚úÖ **Give practical examples**
- "Semaphores are great for implementing connection pools with max connections."

‚úÖ **Compare and contrast**
- "If you need dynamic registration of parties, Phaser is better than CyclicBarrier."

‚ùå **Common mistakes to avoid in interviews:**
- Don't confuse `countDown()` with `await()` functionality
- Don't mix up which utilities are reusable
- Remember exception handling is critical (InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException)
- Be clear about which utility is appropriate for which scenario

‚úÖ **Best practices to mention:**
- Always release resources in finally blocks
- Consider fairness requirements when using Semaphores
- Use the simplest utility that meets requirements
- Properly handle all possible exceptions

Happy interviewing! These concurrency utilities are common interview topics for Java positions, especially at companies dealing with high-performance or distributed systems.

# Method Resolution and Dynamic Method Dispatch in Java üìö

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Method Resolution Fundamentals üîç

Method resolution refers to how Java determines which method to call at compile time and runtime. Understanding this concept is critical for Java interviews and everyday coding.

### Static vs. Dynamic Binding

- **Static Binding (Compile-time)**: Method calls resolved during compilation
  - Applies to: static methods, private methods, final methods
  - Based on the reference type, not the actual object

- **Dynamic Binding (Runtime)**: Method calls resolved during execution
  - Applies to: overridden methods
  - Based on the actual object type, not the reference type

```java
Parent p = new Child(); // Parent reference, Child object
p.display();  // Dynamic binding - calls Child's version
p.staticMethod(); // Static binding - calls Parent's version
```

### Common Interview Mistake ‚ö†Ô∏è

Candidates often confuse method overloading (compile-time) with method overriding (runtime).

---------------------

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Method Dispatch Explained üîÑ

Dynamic Method Dispatch is Java's mechanism for implementing runtime polymorphism, where the JVM determines at runtime which method implementation to invoke.

### Key Principles:

- The method that gets called is determined by the actual object type, not the reference type
- Only overridden methods participate in dynamic dispatch
- It enables polymorphic behavior in Java

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

// Usage
Animal myPet = new Dog();
myPet.makeSound(); // Outputs: "Bark" (Dog's implementation is called)
```

### Interview-Ready Example üìå

```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() { System.out.println("Vehicle starting"); }
    static void info() { System.out.println("Vehicle info"); }
    final void register() { System.out.println("Vehicle registration"); }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void start() { System.out.println("Car starting"); }
    static void info() { System.out.println("Car info"); }
    // Cannot override final method register()
}

// Test code
Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
Vehicle v2 = new Car();
Car c = new Car();

v1.start();  // "Vehicle starting" - obvious
v2.start();  // "Car starting" - dynamic dispatch!
v2.info();   // "Vehicle info" - static binding
c.info();    // "Car info" - static binding
v2.register(); // "Vehicle registration" - final method
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Method Resolution Works üß©

### Resolution Order:

1. Exact match in the class itself
2. Look in parent classes (up the inheritance hierarchy)
3. If multiple matches exist, the most specific one is chosen

### Special Cases:

- **Private methods**: Not inherited, no dynamic dispatch
- **Static methods**: Bound to the reference type, not the object
- **Final methods**: Cannot be overridden, no dynamic dispatch 
- **Constructor calls**: Special invocation, uses `super()` or `this()`

```java
class Parent {
    private void privateMethod() { 
        System.out.println("Parent's private"); 
    }
    
    void test() {
        privateMethod(); // Calls Parent's private method
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    private void privateMethod() { 
        System.out.println("Child's private"); 
    }
    
    @Override
    void test() {
        super.test(); // Calls Parent's test method
        privateMethod(); // Calls Child's private method
    }
}
```

### Interview Trap ‚ö†Ô∏è 

```java
class Base {
    void show() { System.out.println("Base"); }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    @Override
    void show() { System.out.println("Derived"); }
}

Base obj = new Derived();
// What gets printed?
obj.show();  // "Derived" - many candidates get this wrong!
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Interview Insights üí°

### Common Interview Questions:

1. Explain the difference between method overloading and overriding.
   
2. What happens if a child class defines a method with the same name but different return type?
   ```
   Answer: It's a compilation error if only the return type differs.
   ```

3. Can overridden methods have different access modifiers?
   ```
   Answer: Yes, but only if the child's access is broader than the parent's.
   ```

4. How is method resolution affected with interfaces and multiple inheritance?
   ```
   Answer: Most specific implementation is chosen; with ambiguity, explicit casting or method naming is required.
   ```

### Best Practices ‚úÖ

- Use `@Override` annotation to ensure you're actually overriding
- Be cautious when overriding methods in complex inheritance hierarchies
- Understand that overridden methods should maintain the "is-a" relationship
- Avoid method hiding (redefining static methods) as it creates confusion

---------------------

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Cases & Edge Scenarios üî¨

### Interfaces and Default Methods

With Java 8+, interfaces can have default methods, adding complexity to method resolution:

```java
interface Playable {
    default void play() { System.out.println("Playing"); }
}

interface Streamable {
    default void play() { System.out.println("Streaming"); }
}

class MediaPlayer implements Playable, Streamable {
    // Must override play() to resolve conflict
    @Override
    public void play() {
        Playable.super.play(); // Choose which one to call
    }
}
```

### Covariant Return Types

Since Java 5, overridden methods can return more specific types:

```java
class Animal {
    Animal reproduce() { return new Animal(); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    Dog reproduce() { return new Dog(); } // Covariant return
}
```

### Method Resolution with Generics

Generics add another layer to method resolution:

```java
class Box<T> {
    T getContent() { /*...*/ }
}

class SpecialBox<T> extends Box<T> {
    @Override
    T getContent() { /*...*/ } // Valid override
}
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. Forgetting that static methods don't participate in polymorphism
2. Assuming private methods can be overridden
3. Not understanding how `super` calls work in inheritance chains
4. Confusion about how final methods impact method resolution

Remember to review these concepts thoroughly and practice with code examples to cement your understanding for interviews!
